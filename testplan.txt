testEE(): After allocating 1 byte in an array, we immediately free it and reallocate 2 bytes into the same index. After allocation, we then free it again to make sure that the first free was successful and the second malloc was also successful. testFF(): Instead of allocating 1 byte into the current position, we allocate it for the current position +1 then have it freed. testB(), testC(), testE(),testG(),testH(),testI(),testJ(),testK(),testL(), testN(),testO(),testP(),testQ(),testS()consist of both duplicate and a variety of cases. It includes:s- Freeing pointers that have not been malloc’ed and freeing pointers that have already been freed.- Immediate free after malloc- Malloc’ing sizes which exceed the maximum number of bytes that can be allocated.- Memory allocation of multiple blocks but only free’ing less than number of allocated blocks. - Allocating memory for multiple blocks and verifying successful coalesce on adjacent free blocks. (Covering cases 1 2 and 3. More details on readme.pdf)- Immediately free’ing an allocated block and re-allocating the same block. - Memory allocate for exactly 4096 bytes and requesting for more allocation. -
